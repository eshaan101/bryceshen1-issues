## Step 3: Assigning Issues

_Great job creating a new issue! ðŸ‘‹_

**What is Issue Assigning?**: Assigning an Issue to a team member is an opportunity for the project manager to assign the issue specifically to a team member for them to finish by a specific deadline. This helps properly and efficiently delegate tasks, ensuring that nothing is left unfinished.

### :keyboard: Activity: Assign an Issue

1. Open the issue you want to assign.
2. On the right side of the issue page, locate the **Assignees** section.
3. Click the **Assignees** field and select the appropriate person from the list of contributors.
4. Assign yourself or someone else to the issue.

1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
