## Step 2: Labels and Milestones

_Track your progress with milestones! :dart:_

**What are Milestones?**: Milestones track progress on groups of issues or pull requests in a repository. When you create a milestone, you can associate it with issues and pull requests. This helps you better manage and visualize your project's progress.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create and manage a milestone

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click **Issues**.
3. Next to the search field, click **Milestones**.
4. Choose one of these options:
   - To create a new milestone, click **New Milestone**.
   - To edit an existing milestone, next to the milestone you want to edit, click **Edit**.
5. Above the list of issues, select the **Milestone** dropdown menu.
6. You can filter by the name of an existing milestone, then click the milestone's name to associate it with the item.

1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
