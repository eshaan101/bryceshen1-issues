As you continue working with GitHub Issues, keep in mind that effective issue tracking and management help improve the success of your projects. If you're new to a repository, make sure to ask about the project’s issue management practices so you can get started efficiently.

Here’s a quick summary of the tasks you’ve completed in GitHub Issues so far:

- Created a new issue to track tasks, bugs, or feature requests.
- Learned how to label and organize issues for better clarity and workflow.
- Assigned issues to team members to delegate tasks effectively.
- Collaborated with your team by commenting on issues and @mentioning relevant users.
- Resolved issues by marking them as closed or reopened them as needed.
- Learned how to update labels and milestones to keep progress on track.

### What's next?

- Try adding a [`CODEOWNERS`](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) file to your project to automatically assign reviewers to pull requests.
