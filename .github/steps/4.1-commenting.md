## Step 4: Collaborating on Issues

_Well done assigning an issue! ðŸ‘‹_

**What is collaboration on issues?**: Collaboration on issues is an array of ways for teams to work together, manage, and resolve issues. It involves communication, feedback, and teamwork to track, solve, and complete problems effectively.

Some key points of collaboration on issues include:
- **Commenting**: Team members can comment on an issue to ask questions, provide feedback, or clarify details.
- **@Mentions**: You can @mention team members in comments to notify them and involve them directly in the conversation.
- **Tracking Progress**: Team members can update the status or provide updates, keeping everyone informed about the progress.
