## Step 1: Creating an Issue

_Welcome to GitHub Issues! :wave:_

Let's get started by creating an issue.

**What is an Issue?**: An Issue is a task, bug, or feature request that you can follow up on within a project. It's a great way to manage tasks and let your team know what they need to get done.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create an Issue

1. Go to the **Issues** tab in your GitHub repository.
2. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
3. Under your repository name, click **Issues**.
4. Click **New issue** to create a new issue.
5. If your repository uses issue templates, click **Get started** next to the type of issue you'd like to open.
6. If the type of issue you'd like to open isn't included in the available options, click **Open a blank issue**.
7. In the **Title** field, type a title for your issue—typically one that summarizes the task/problem.
8. In the comment body field, type a description of your issue. Provide a detailed background that summarizes the issue and necessary information/steps.
> *You can also assign the issue to someone, add it to a project, associate it with a milestone, set the issue type, and apply a label, but you will learn those later in the skill.*

9. When you're finished, click **Submit new issue**.
10. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
