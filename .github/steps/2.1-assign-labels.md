## Step 2: Labels and Milestones

_Let's get organized with labels and milestones! :label:_

**What are Labels?**: Labels are used to organize issues, pull requests, and discussions by creating, editing, applying, and deleting labels under issues. Once a label exists, you can apply it to any issue, pull request, or discussion within that repository.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a label

1. Under your repository name, click **Issues**.
2. In the horizontal navigation bar, the **Issues** tab is outlined in orange.
3. Above the list of issues or pull requests, click **Labels**.
4. To the right of the search field, click **New label**.
5. Under **Label name**, type a name for your label.
6. Under **Description**, type a description to help others understand and use your label.
7. To create the label, click **Create label** (or **Save changes**/**Delete** depending on your task).


1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
